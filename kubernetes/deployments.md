# Deployment
- Deployment controller is watching the ETCD, when there is not enough pod, it will create entry in ETCD in the replicaset 
- Replicaset controller will then create entry in ETCD for the pods to be created 
- When Update is done:
    - The deployment controller adds the entry for n/2 pods with the new version
    - The replicaset controller then adds the pods with the new pods entry in the ETCD
    - This triggers, the creation of new pods
    - after these starts running, the old pods entry is reduced and this triggers the deletion through the same process
    - eventually all the pods are replaced in this manner
    - the deployment controller watches the replication table also
    - the replication controller watches the pods table also
