# Docker
- What are docker images?
    - They are 
- BIOS -> MBR -> Bootloader for OS -> Kernel -> initialization process -> Application
- Corrupted on VM does not affect the physical machine
- Hyper visor helps to create a VMs
- 

- docker uses linux capabilities, all processes run on the host machine
- image layers are stored in overlay2 folder
- container run time performance can be affected if we have many layers
- reduce number of layers by combining layers and also multistage building
- images are alyered file systems
- Cow(copy on write) improves performance by initially loafing the containers fast
- copy vs add - add has the ability to download from url also
- add is vulnerable to attack, to download use run wget or curl ( This can help in reducing layers as it can be combined with other run command)


# Namespaces

- why so VMs appear different
    - Network space
    - User space
    - file space
    - Process space
    - Hostname space
    - IPC and RPC

- C groups - control groups
    - The kernel can find all the running processes
    - Docker leverages this by using to kill processes when required

# Docker Volumes

- Docker containers are ephimeral
    - need to be stateless
    - Primary, Secondary and Tertiary architecture for SQL databases
    - The leader election and splitting architecture for NoSQL

- Volumes are like a mounted folder from the host machine
    - the mounted folder can then be accessed by containers. 
- docker volume types
    - tempfs
        - syntax --mount type=tempfs 
        - to keep the writable layer small
    - bind mount Volumes
        - starts with / or path after -v
    - Volumes
        - Anonymous Volumes
        - Named Volumes
        - Volumes always gets created inside the root docker folder, there is a folder called volumes there
        - syntax: -v volumeName (don't give /, if there is not a volume in theat name, it will be created)
            - -v volumename 1<where in host> 2<where in container> 3<mode>
            - only mandatory param is the second param
                - When only 1 param is given -> anonymous volume 

- process isolation is pseudo isolation
